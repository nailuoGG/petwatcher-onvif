** Motivation

I have three cats at home that I absolutely adore, but every time I travel, I have to leave them behind. I set up CCTV cameras to ease my worries, but being away means I can’t always keep an eye on them.

That’s why I built this software to look after my little furballs (dogs are welcome too) when I’m not around.
